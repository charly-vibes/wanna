## espectacular

Run `ah check` to verify spec-test correspondence before committing.

- `ah check` — validate all deployed specs
- `ah check --changes <name>` — validate with a change overlay
- `ah init` — set up or refresh espectacular project files
- `ah doctor` — diagnose setup issues
- `ah explain <topic>` — playbook guidance for finding kinds and suggested actions
- `ah doctor --enable <adapter>` — write adapter config into .espectacular/config.toml
- `ah signals` — emit dont drift signals

<!-- WAI:START --># Workflow Tools

This project uses **wai** to track the *why* behind decisions — research,
reasoning, and design choices that shaped the code. Run `wai status` first
to orient yourself.

Detected workflow tools:
- **wai** — research, reasoning, and design decisions
- **beads** — issue tracking (tasks, bugs, dependencies). CLI command: **`bd`** (not `beads`)
- **openspec** — specifications and change proposals (see `openspec/AGENTS.md`)

> **CRITICAL**: Apply TDD and Tidy First throughout — not just when writing code:
> - **Planning/task creation**: each ticket should map to a red→green→refactor cycle; refactoring tasks must be separate tickets from feature tasks.
> - **Design**: define the test shape (inputs/outputs) before designing the implementation.
> - **Implementation**: write the failing test first, then make it pass, then tidy in a separate commit.

> **When beginning research or creating a ticket**: run `wai search "<topic>"` to check for existing patterns before writing new content.

## Quick Start

1. `wai sync` — ensure agent tools are projected
2. `wai status` — see active projects, phase, and suggestions
3. `bd ready` — find available work items

When context reaches ~40%: stop and tell the user — responses degrade past
this point. Recommend `wai close` then `/clear` to resume cleanly.
Do NOT skip `wai close` — it enables resume detection.

## Available Pipelines

| Pipeline | When to Use | Start |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| corpus-gates | Working beads wanna-agl/fhl/bvp/u08/9nc on the specodelic corpus | `wai pipeline start corpus-gates --topic=<topic>` |

> Pipeline steps may have gates that enforce artifact creation, review coverage, and oracle checks before advancement. Run `wai pipeline gates <name>` for details.
> **Before any edit**: run `wai pipeline current --json`; if a run is active for this project, resume it (`wai pipeline next`) rather than starting ad-hoc work.

## Autonomous Work Policy

Proceed without routine confirmation when the next step is clear.
Do not ask to continue, fix, or commit — just do it.

**Stop and ask** only when:
- Conflicting requirements or ambiguous intent
- Destructive actions (data loss, force-push, drop table)
- Credentials, secrets, or external services not yet authorized
- Unresolved test failures after two attempts
- Push, deploy, or release — always get explicit authorization
- Context approaching 40% — recommend `wai close` then `/clear`

## Detailed Instructions

Full workflow reference — session lifecycle, capturing work, command cheat
sheets, cross-tool sync, and PARA structure — lives in **`.wai/AGENTS.md`**.
Read it at the start of your first session or when you need detailed guidance.

Keep this managed block so `wai init` can refresh the instructions.

## Accumulated Project Patterns

Project-specific conventions, gotchas, and architecture notes live in
`.wai/resources/reflections/`. Run `wai search "<topic>"` to retrieve relevant
context before starting research or creating tickets.

> **Before research or ticket creation**: always run `wai search "<topic>"` to
> check for known patterns. Do not rediscover what is already documented.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/core-concepts/sync-concepts.md for details and anti-patterns.

## Agent Context Profiles

The managed Beads block is task-tracking guidance, not permission to override repository, user, or orchestrator instructions.

- **Conservative (default)**: Use `bd` for task tracking. Do not run git commits, git pushes, or Dolt remote sync unless explicitly asked. At handoff, report changed files, validation, and suggested next commands.
- **Minimal**: Keep tool instruction files as pointers to `bd prime`; use the same conservative git policy unless active instructions say otherwise.
- **Team-maintainer**: Only when the repository explicitly opts in, agents may close beads, run quality gates, commit, and push as part of session close. A current "do not commit" or "do not push" instruction still wins.

## Session Completion

This protocol applies when ending a Beads implementation workflow. It is subordinate to explicit user, repository, and orchestrator instructions.

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create beads for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **Handle git/sync by active profile**:
   ```bash
   # Conservative/minimal/default: report status and proposed commands; wait for approval.
   git status

   # Team-maintainer opt-in only, unless current instructions forbid it:
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status
   ```
5. **Hand off** - Summarize changes, validation, issue status, and any blocked sync/commit/push step

**Critical rules:**
- Explicit user or orchestrator instructions override this Beads block.
- Do not commit or push without clear authority from the active profile or the current user request.
- If a required sync or push is blocked, stop and report the exact command and error.
